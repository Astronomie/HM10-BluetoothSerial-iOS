# HM10 Bluetooth Serial iOS
This is a simple iOS 8.4 app that lets you communicate with a HM10 Bluetooth UART module. This way you can communicate from your iPhone/iPad with e.g. an Arduino.

Coming soon to an appstore near you (Waiting for Review...)

The helper class for the bluetooth communication can also be found [here](https://github.com/hoiberg/SwiftBluetoothSerial).
